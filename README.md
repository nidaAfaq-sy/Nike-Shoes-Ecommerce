Nike Shoes - E-commerce Website

Introduction

I have created an e-commerce website for selling shoes, offering the best user experience. This platform is built with Next.js 14 for the frontend and provides high-quality shoes for both men and women. The backend is powered by Sanity, ensuring dynamic data updates and a seamless shopping experience.

Technology Stack

Frontend: Next.js (v14)

Backend: Sanity CMS

Data Migration: Mock API, with data imported into Sanity using a migration script file (importSanityData.mjs). The data is retrieved using Groq queries and rendered dynamically on the UI.

Project Aim

The primary goal of this project is to:

Deliver authenticated products with a focus on customer trust.

Provide the best user experience, where users feel confident and comfortable.

Create a dynamic, modern, and visually appealing marketplace.
